<summary>✅ v2.1 Admin Booking Management & Payment Recovery (Phases 62-64) — SHIPPED 2026-08-26</summary>

**Milestone Goal:** Give the operator full control of the booking lifecycle inside the admin panel — edit bookings with automatic client notification, capture abandoned/unpaid bookings for follow-up, and create bookings with an attachable payment link and client email.

- [x] **Phase 62: Abandoned & Unpaid Booking Capture** — Checkout attempts persisted before payment completes, surfaced as a followable unpaid queue in admin, reconciled without duplicates on payment success (4/4 plans, completed 2026-08-20)
- [x] **Phase 63: Admin Booking Editing + Change Notification** — Operator edits schedule/vehicle/route/passenger, server-authoritative price-change review, optional branded change-notification email, per-field edit audit log (5/5 plans, completed 2026-08-21)
- [x] **Phase 64: Admin-Created Bookings with Payment Link** — Admin-originated bookings with optional Stripe payment link + client email, auto no-duplicate reconcile (incl. round-trip both legs), or no-link cash/invoice save (4/4 plans, completed 2026-08-25)

**Audit:** passed — 19/19 requirements satisfied, cross-phase integration sound, all E2E flows complete. See [milestones/v2.1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md](milestones/v2.1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md).
